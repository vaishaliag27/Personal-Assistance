# Personal-Assistance

A personal- assistance made by converting the OS based program into a menu driven program using Python Code.
Used different libraries, packages and modules available in python like:
pyttsx3, datetime, speech_recognition, os, webbrowser, wikipedia etc. to create my own personal assistance.
This personal assistance is capable in communicating with both oral and written method.

more changes will be made with time.
